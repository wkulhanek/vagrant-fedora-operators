Vagrantfile for a Fedore 28 machine with OpenShift Client stuff installed

Read this entire README before running *vagrant up*.

=== Overview

* This configuration uses a standard vagrant insecure key
* Generate a key called *vagrant.pem* and place it into *$HOME/.ssh*.
+
[source,ruby]
----
ssh_keys = ["~/.vagrant.d/insecure_private_key", "~/.ssh/vagrant.pem" ]
----

* Private network setup
** Allows VM to appear as full, local, network citizen and simplifies use of ssh, ansible etc
** If you need to change the IP Address you will also need to change the IP Address in the file *inventory* which Ansible uses to configure the VM.
+
[source,ruby]
----
ip = "192.168.10.10"
----

* Hostname - Feel free to change
+
[source,ruby]
----
hostname = "fedoravm"
----

* Mounts the directory *~/Development* into the VM as */home/vagrant/development*.
** Change to reflect your environment
+
[source,ruby]
----
local_folder = "~/Development"
remote_mount = "/home/vagrant/development"
----

=== Ansible Configuration

* This Configuration uses an Ansible Playbook to initially set up the VM.
* The Vagrantfile executes the Ansible Playbook *configure_box.yml* upon first start of the Vagrant VM.
** To execute again after the VM has already been provisioned:
+
[source,bash]
----
vagrant provision
----
